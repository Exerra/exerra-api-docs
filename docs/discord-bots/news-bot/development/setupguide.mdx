# Setup instructions

This page will instruct you on how to setup Newsify

## Requirements
To fully setup Newsify, you will need a Discord and Google account. If you do not have them already, go create them.

## Discord token
This is going to be super simple

1. Go to [discord.com/developers/applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and **click on the button "New application"**

2. Name your application<br/>

3. Now you have an application, but not a bot! To get a bot, **click on the "Bot" tab** on the sidebar, then **click on "Add bot"**. When it asks you if you *really* want to create a bot, just **say yes**!

4. To get the token, **click on "Reset Token" and then "Copy"** under the token while on the Bot tab. Now, be careful where you put it since **tokens are basically like usernames and passwords for bots**.

## Google Firebase

1. Go to the [Google Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/) and create a new project (make sure to turn off Google Analytics)
2. Create a new Web App and name it `Discord bot`. When you reach the "Add Firebase SDK" section, copy the `firebaseConfig` const
3. This is a bit of a hack, but go into the terminal and type `node`. There, execute this command and then copy what was logged
	```js title="Node REPL Environment"
	console.log(JSON.stringify(firebaseConf))
	```
4. Put it somewhere so you can paste it into .env later (field is `FIREBASE_CONF`)
5. Navigate to "Cloud Firestore" (alternate name: "Firestore Database") and create a database in test mode (also, select the closest location for the server you will be deploying the bot on)
6. Create a new collection in the database called `setting` (Auto-ID the document and add some random field)

## Putting that all in .env
So, clone/fork the repo and create an .env file.

For each field, add the content to it in the .env file after the `=` (Remember, no spaces)

| Field              | Content             |
|--------------------|---------------------|
| TOKEN              | Discord token       |
| APPID              | Bots ID             |
| GUILDID            | Test guild ID       |
| FIREBASE_CONF      | Firebase config      |
