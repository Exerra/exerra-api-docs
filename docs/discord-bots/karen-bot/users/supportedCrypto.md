# Supported crypto currencies

> Didn't know Karen Bot wanted to burn down acres of forests every time someone wants to buy a fucking overpriced jpg that ISNT EVEN HOSTED IN THE BLOCKCHAIN BUT LITERALLY IS JUST A URL TO AN IMAGE STORED IN SOMEONES SERVERS WHICH MEANS THE CONTENT CAN BE CHANGED OR JUST DISSAPEAR

Karen Bot has a very nifty command that lets people search up the prices of supported crypto currencies üí∞Ô∏è

You can search these
* Bitcoin
* Ethereum
* Litecoin
* Dogecoin
* Dash
* Ripple
* Groestlcoin
* Stellar

... and their short versions (e.g BTC, ETH and so on)!

You can search for those crypto currencies by typing `m!crypto [currency]` and you will get a beautiful embed with your results
