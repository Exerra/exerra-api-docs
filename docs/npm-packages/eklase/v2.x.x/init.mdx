# Initialization
To initialize `eklase` you need to use a constructor. Learn more about them [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes/constructor)

## Steps
1. Import the package
```js
const EKlase = require("eklase").default // CommonJS
import EKlase from "eklase" // ES6 and TypeScript
```
2. Create a const with the construcotr and pass in a username & password.
```js
const EKlase = require("eklase").default // CommonJS
import EKlase from "eklase" // ES6 and TypeScript

let eklase = new EKlase("USERNAME", "PASSWORD")
```
Now you're done, hooray!

## Authorisation flow

The way E-Klase handles auth is when you send a POST request for login, E-Klase will put the auth cookie in the `Set-Cookie` header of the 302 page.

An example of the POST request is:
```http request
POST /?v=15 HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Host: my.e-klase.lv
Connection: close
Content-Length: 46

fake_pass=&UserName=USERNAME&Password=PASSWORD
```

    <summary>Authorisation changes between v1 and v2</summary>
    <div>
		<h3>v1</h3>
		<p>In v1 of <code>eklase</code> authorisation was handled on initialisation, and because of that the <code>keepAlive</code> optional parameter was added as the session expires after a while. Alongside that, if the user were to log into E-Klase themselves, the session would get deleted as E-Klase operates on a one-session-at-a-time basis.</p>
		<br />
		<br />
		<h3>v2</h3>
		<p>In v2 of <code>eklase</code> authorisation is handled by each function every time they get invoked, which ensures that old sessions and other logins are no longer a problem. With this system the function latency will increase a bit, but the added benefits well outweigh the benefits.</p>
